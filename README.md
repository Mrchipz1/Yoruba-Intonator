The goal of this project is to infer the full marking(accents and diactitics) of yoruba words, which are ill specified because they were typed with the english character set. 

For a demo, go to https://yoruba-intonator.herokuapp.com

If you need a source for input yoruba sentences, this link has many unmarked sentences: https://yo.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80w%E1%BB%8Dn_%E1%BB%8Dm%E1%BB%8D_Yor%C3%B9b%C3%A1
