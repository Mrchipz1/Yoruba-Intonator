The goal of this project is to infer the full marking(accents and diactitics) of yoruba words, which are ill specified because they were typed with the english character set. 

For a demo, run intonator.py and type in a word. 

Right now, you will see all the possible intended fully marked yoruba words. Eventually, we shold be able to put in a sentence and the intonator will fully mark it (more precisely, embellish it with the most likely markings).
